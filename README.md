first version of Say-le Clock 
(wordplay on "Saylor clock")
24 03 2025

A cool looking, live Bitcoin price and block ticker.
It changes colors on some special days, and makes a sound on for every new found block in the bitcoin blockchain. 
Every 3rd block, it spews out a random bitcoiner quote as well. It has an optional background music effect.
